About me
=============

*I have been working as a planning manager for couple of years. Before that I worked in many positions on trade sector. I have earlier studied industrial engineering and I have a master´s degree from Lappeenranta University of Technology. 
On my free time I like to spend time with loved ones, go out and enjoy the nature and travel. We have been travelling a lot, some favorites to mention: Seychelles, Borneo an Iceland.*

Loved these landscapes in Iceland:

*I haven´t actually been studing computer science before. But this autumn I decided to take a beginner course in programming and this Introduction to DevOps course via opportunity that FiTech offers. 
I want to keep improving myself learning new things keeps me going. I think that these skills will be important to master in future.*
