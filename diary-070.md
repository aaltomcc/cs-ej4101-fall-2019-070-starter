Why am I in this course?
========================

*Honestly, before taking this course I hardly ever knew what word DevOps means. That is also reason why I didn´t have any specific expextacions and I was kind of taking risk. But I am interested about doing some projects where I could benefit to know how to use GitHUb etc in the future. I want to understand how tasks are organized within development enviroment and how to plan and manage co-operation.*

*I also want to keep every door open because there is a possibility that I want to study an other degree some day and computer science is an option.*

*In the summer I spotted an advertisement about FITech offering opportunity to participate ICT courses at universities for free and I decided to apply in some courses and test if this field would suit me or not. And I have been pleased that I chose to take part these interesting courses.* 

What have I learned?
====================

*On this course I have learned bit of the basics and I am able to continue studying more. Actually I need to admit that having background with supply chains etc. I found quite a lot common overcomes with earlier studies  eventhough the field was then economics and engineering. But for example Kaizen, method is the same for supply chains and DevOps. I think I´ll have found a different point of view about topics I have allready learned within my former degree and there is many things I can benefit within studying DevOps and other ICT courses.*

* I have tools to manage version history and deadlines
* I have learned to create GitHub account
	* I know how to use basic tools 
	* I can publish a site
* I am familiar with writing with Markdown language
	* I can use different styles within text
	* I can use links to other sites
	* I know how to add a picture on site
* I have took a look at projects that other students have created in this course. I now know how projects looks like for other peopleviewing them in GitHub if those are public.
